Hi, Iâ€™m Paul.  I'm an engineer who has a background in Canadian Energy, and has used that knowledge to write software for the sometimes anedated Energy Industry. A lot of the code in here is just some playing around stuff, but if you want to see some of my non-public repos (work that I have done for clients) just get in contact with me and I'll be happy to show you!  

My goal is to write clean, and maintainable code that helps companies solve problems, or provide solutions.  Writing software is my passion, and collaborating with a good team of developers and engineers is what truely makes me happy. I'm fluent in a ton of different technologies/languages (and can make a passable effort through many more), but my experience and expertise so far lies in creating web applications with React or Svelte frontend (I prefer typescript over Javascript), C# and F# webAPI backend in .NET, SQL DB and everything Azure. I'm also competent in vb.NET from the early days, and familiar with tons of different widely used libraries and packages. 

I have an undergrad in Engineering, a Full Stack Developer diploma, and an MBA with a specialization in finance, as well as more than a decade of experience working in energy, and software. 

When I'm not writing code, I'm usually out in the mountains, biking, golfing, hiking, paddle boarding, or just enjoying some time in the sun.
